ClI_MaterialsP
=============

Example of how to make a Post call to /api/v1/classrooms/{domain_id}/materials for Android.

This example was made using Android Studio and uses an old version of our API library, that is already included in the example. The only call that does not use our library is the one that gives his name to this example.
